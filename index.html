        <h3 class="header4-text">After a long struggle, you finally admit that you need help. You decide to hire an essay writing service to help you with your assignments. 
            And that’s when you’re greeted with the next wave of challenges:

    <ul class="potential-ul">
<p><span class="ul-keywords">You could get a poor-quality paper:</span> </p>
        <p>Most writers on essay writing services are not native English speakers. You could get a paper full of plagiarism, poor grammar, doesn’t follow instructions, poor formatting, poor punctuation. They could even sell a paper that was previously written for someone else, only to find out much later, after the professor calls you in, and you have no explanation</p>
<p><span class="ul-keywords">Your private information could be released</span></p>
<p>This is the worst absolute nightmare. What if some of your schoolmates see your details on such a site? What if it ends up on the professor’s desk, and then you are caught for academic plagiarism? Your program is terminated there and then</p>
       <p><span class="ul-keywords">No options to customize your paper:</span></p>
<p> Most services are doing large-scale ‘production’ of assignments, and, they have no time to customize your assignment to look like your own paper. What if they give you a paper that is way above your writing standard, for example, if English is your second language, and then the professor detects something wrong? And then you get caught for handing in work that is not your own?</p>
       <p><span class="ul-keywords">How expensive will it be, OVER TIME?</span></p>
<p>They key is the word, “over time”. You could pay for one paper, and get it done. How about through the semester, for all the work? How much will it come to? Will you be able to afford?</p>
  <p><span class="ul-keywords">Guarantee:</span> </p>
  <p>You could pay for a paper and get one, then hand it in, only for the grades to come back a week or 2 weeks later. You lose all the money you paid. How do you get compensated for that? Because, you have just lost your money, time and grades. How sad!</p>

    I’ll be the first to tell you, you don’t only need an expert essay writing service to help you. They could be useful once, they could help you get good grades, but it just ends there, with your business. At the end of the day, you end up having nobody to advice you on how to go about life, you have nobody to make it easy to afford term papers over time, and nobody is guiding you on making your school life easier.

            <p> This is like my daily bread. Papers I do very often. Whether it is a simple 275-word essay, or a complex 5000-word essay, or more, be it argumentative essay, Compare/Contrast essay or whatever kind of an essay, I am well equipped with these.</p>

<p>Whether analytical or argumentative. These are my personal best papers having written them for such a long time. I understand the quality and types of sources needed to get this paper to be a quality paper.</p>
<p><span class="ul-keywords">Annotated bibliography</span></p>
 <p> You will need a list of citations from proper information such as, articles, books and documents. Then, each citation will be accompanied by some brief description to explain the relevance of the work cited.</p>
           <p><span class="ul-keywords">Report </span> </p> 
<p> Require a well-planned, well organized document that defines and explains, with clear analysis a provided problem or subject? I have done many before.</p>
<p><span class="ul-keywords">Movie/book review</span></p>
<p>Writing these is interesting, but sometimes you need to gather all information after going through the content, with painstaking detail, and maybe you want to avoid the headache. I have you covered.</p>
<p><span class="ul-keywords">Literature Review</span></p>
  <p>You will need a proper completely broad search of content available on a specific topic, and that results into a list of, periodicals, references to books and more material on the topic at hand. It’s tasking many times, I know.</p>
           <p><span class="ul-keywords">Creative writing</span></p>
           <p> Hard to express your feeling, ideas and points on paper? I can help with that too.</p>
<p><span class="ul-keywords">Distance Learning courses</span></p>
<p>I have helped students who have done distance learning courses who said, “here, take my logins, I will check every week to see the grades are okay”</p>
   <p><span class="ul-keywords">More</span></p>
   <p>I only don’t deal with technical papers in I.T and computer science, and engineering practical. Any paper that requires theory and research is my area. Need clarification about an assignment/topic? Sign up HERE and ask me.</p>

        <p>Most sites charge between $13-$25 for High school, $17-$35 for college/undergraduate and $22-$45 for master’s papers. They have writers and overheads to take care of, which add to the huge pile. I got you a better cheaper deal? Right?</p>

        <ul class="pricing-ul">
            <li>Assignments with shorter deadlines are more expensive. They will need me to drop everything (including sleep) to write your paper. I consider very urgent papers to be those with less than 24 hours deadline.</li>
            <li>Each price is per page, and one page is considered to be 275 words.</li>

    </div>
    <div class="prevent-problem">
        <h3 class="faq-h3">What do you do to prevent problems from coming up? And which problems in this case?</h3>
        <p class="faq-p">Plagiarism: I use a plagiarism checker software, (Turnitin- used by educational institutions) and attach the plagiarism report with your assignment. For grammar, I use Grammarly, a grammar checking software to crosscheck grammar. Every paper will be well formatted according to instructions, and, you will get the outline for the paper, to show the paper was written from scratch with complete originality. You will also get updates on your assignment so you can keep tracking your order.</p>
 </div>
    <div class="promises">
<h3 class="faq-h3">Despite all these promises and your credentials, what if, just what if, things go wrong? How bad can they get? </h3>
<p class="faq-p">I’ll admit I’m not perfect and I will also admit, working with clients all this while, problems show up here and there. But even in the worst possible scenario, let me make a few things clear that will never happen; Plagiarism, papers not written from scratch and poor grammar in your paper will never happen. I guarantee. Sometimes however, some problems that are uncontrollable can come up. The common cases that affect would be time for the paper and there could be a revision, due to a slight mistake. Sometimes also students don’t give full instructions for the paper, and thus the points are not addressed. Make sure you provide everything.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="fix-problem">
        <h3 class="faq-h3">How would you fix problems which have already come up?</h3>
         <p class="faq-p">There’s almost no case we cannot fix, since they are not major cases for which an explanation to the professor is impossible. However, some cases, just as the professor/instructor know coulc not be avoided. I will work with you, for FREE to deal with such issues, until they are resolved completely. I will draft letters on your behalf to your instructor and do anything to fix them. The paper may thus be delayed just a while, for which I will notify you in advance. Try sending me your paper as early as possible, just to prevent such cases. In case your paper needs a revision, after the professor grades it, I will do it for FREE, provided you have the paper grading from the professor. 
            Though this is not necessary, because I trust my quality, I will still give you a money-back full refund, if your paper gets a poor grade.

    <p>You’re in this for a couple of years- why not make the best of memories about life, rather than live a stressed and unfulfilled life all along.</p>
    <p>You are directly responsible to make your life easier, more fulfilling and liberating than it is now. Why not do it?</p>
    <p>Imagine how much more time, energy and freedom it would be if you escaped all the hasstle of completing those college assignments.</p>
    <p>Why not, from today henceforth, choose to value your peace and satisfaction, freedom, health and well-being over things which won’t matter years from now?</p>
